# KUATO CLI

Repo for the Kuato command line script, formatted for publishing as an npm module.

`npm install -g kuato`

This package installs the command line script for kuato, which builds a grunt-based static site scaffold. See https://github.com/cemckinley/kuato for scaffold repo and usage.

Grunt 0.3.17 is also installed globally with this package. At some point in the future when a stable grunt 0.4 is released, grunt-cli instead will be installed globally, and a local copy of grunt installed with each project created with the 'kuato' command.
